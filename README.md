==============

A Breakable Toy to play around with NodeJS and supporting packages and MongoDB

Basic idea is that I want to be able to reward my kids with virtual tickets for doing nice things instead of physical ones that either get lost or that I never have around when I want one.

Steps to run the app
=====================
* After cloning the repo, install the dependencies by running **npm install**
* To start the server, run **npm start** on the base directory

Prerequisites
============
The server assumes that you have a local mongo instance running. This means if you have mongo installed locally, all you need to do is configure the db.js file correctly and run the mongod daemon
